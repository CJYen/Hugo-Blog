title: Why Hugo?

Today, I'd tried two frameworks, Gatsbyjs and Hugo, which are very different. One with JavaScript and another in Golang language.
I must say, Hugo, it blows my mind. 

On the first try, I choose Gatsbyjs is for the speedy response. I found it reacts fast enough that I cannot notice any lag.  I wasn't trying to use Hugo since I found it's a tiny bit slower than Gatsbyjs while I browsed around with some other sites. 
But, as I can imagine, there is always something wrong while installing these packages. And yes, it does happen. However, I can take plenty of time to figure it out and solve the problem. Then soon, I realized that my purpose is to publish some exciting blog and not try to master in Front-end. It also makes a breakpoint for me to step back and rethink what's the main point of all this. 

Finally, I try to install Hugo. And surprisingly, it's much better than I thought. It can deploy fast enough, and  I can focus on the article instead of the technical problem of the front-end.
